Tree traverse problem
105. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal
106. Construct Binary Tree from Inorder and Postorder Traversal
331. Verify Preorder Serialization of a Binary Tree
971. Flip Binary Tree To Match Preorder Traversal
1028. Recover a Tree From Preorder Traversal
1569. Number of Ways to Reorder Array to Get Same BST
1597. Build Binary Expression Tree From Infix Expression

1028 has serialize and deserialize a tree: preorder dft 
To serialize with special char for null will be enough to 
Desrialize. 331 to verify such a serialize. 1028 use 
Level to matk so extra work to deserialize
1597 is different from others. Need two stack
105 and 105 are the same, find the root and recurse, 
They do Not have marker so need two traveses
