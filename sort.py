# 1. bucket sort: find biggerst value and make an array of that size. turn on index of element value
# 
# # O(n^2)
# 2. bubble sort: compare each adjecent number an swap if possible 
# 
# 3. selection sort: The algorithm works by selecting the smallest unsorted item and then swapping it with the item in the next position to be filled
# 
# 4. Insertion Sort: To sort unordered list of elements, we remove its entries one at a time and then insert each of them into a sorted part (initially empty):
# 
# # O(n log n)
# 
# 5. mergesort.  https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/recursion-ii/470/divide-and-conquer/2868/

# 6. heapsort
# 
# 
# 
# 7. quicksort: pick one (last or middle) and move smaller left and larger to right, repeat on both sides (divide and conquer (O(nlogn) or O(n^2)
