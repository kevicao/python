850. Rectangle Area II


https://leetcode.com/problems/rectangle-area-ii/solution/


# Suppose instead of rectangles = [[0,0,2,2],[1,0,2,3],[1,0,3,1]], we had [[0,0,200,200],[100,0,200,300],[100,0,300,100]]. The answer would just be 100 times bigger.

# What about if rectangles = [[0,0,2,2],[1,0,2,3],[1,0,30002,1]] ? Only the blue region would have area 30000 instead of 1.

# Our idea is this: we'll take all the x and y coordinates, and re-map them to 0, 1, 2, ... etc. For example, if rectangles = [[0,0,200,200],[100,0,200,300],[100,0,300,100]], we could re-map it to [[0,0,2,2],[1,0,2,3],[1,0,3,1]]. Then, we can solve the problem with brute force. However, each region may actually represent some larger area, so we'll need to adjust for that at the end.

# Algorithm

# Re-map each x coordinate to 0, 1, 2, .... Independently, re-map all y coordinates too.

# We then have a problem that can be solved by brute force: for each rectangle with re-mapped coordinates (rx1, ry1, rx2, ry2), we can fill the grid grid[x][y] = True for rx1 <= x < rx2 and ry1 <= y < ry2.

# Afterwards, each grid[rx][ry] represents the area (imapx(rx+1) - imapx(rx)) * (imapy(ry+1) - imapy(ry)), where if x got remapped to rx, then imapx(rx) = x ("inverse-map-x of remapped-x equals x"), and similarly for imapy.

            Yvals.add(y1); Yvals.add(y2)

        mapx = {x: i for i, x in enumerate(imapx)}
        mapy = {y: i for i, y in enumerate(imapy)}

        grid = [[0] * len(imapy) for _ in imapx]

                for y in xrange(mapy[y1], mapy[y2]):
                    grid[x][y] = 1

        ans = 0

            for y, val in enumerate(row):
                if val:
                    ans += (imapx[x+1] - imapx[x]) * (imapy[y+1] - imapy[y])

Approach #2: Line Sweep
Intuition

Imagine we pass a horizontal line from bottom to top over the shape. We have some active intervals on this horizontal line, which gets updated twice for each rectangle. In total, there are 2 * N2∗N events, and we can update our (up to NN) active horizontal intervals for each update.

Algorithm

For a rectangle like rec = [1,0,3,1], the first update is to add [1, 3] to the active set at y = 0, and the second update is to remove [1, 3] at y = 1. Note that adding and removing respects multiplicity - if we also added [0, 2] at y = 0, then removing [1, 3] at y = 1 will still leave us with [0, 2] active.

This gives us a plan: create these two events for each rectangle, then process all the events in sorted order of y. The issue now is deciding how to process the events add(x1, x2) and remove(x1, x2) such that we are able to query() the total horizontal length of our active intervals.

We can use the fact that our remove(...) operation will always be on an interval that was previously added. Let's store all the (x1, x2) intervals in sorted order. Then, we can query() in linear time using a technique similar to a classic LeetCode problem, Merge Intervals.

class Solution(object):
    def rectangleArea(self, rectangles):
        # Populate events
        OPEN, CLOSE = 0, 1
        events = []
        for x1, y1, x2, y2 in rectangles:
            events.append((y1, OPEN, x1, x2))
            events.append((y2, CLOSE, x1, x2))
        events.sort()

        def query():
            ans = 0
            cur = -1
            for x1, x2 in active:
                cur = max(cur, x1)
                ans += max(0, x2 - cur)
                cur = max(cur, x2)
            return ans

        active = []
        cur_y = events[0][0]
        ans = 0
        for y, typ, x1, x2 in events:
            # For all vertical ground covered, update answer
            ans += query() * (y - cur_y)

            # Update active intervals
            if typ is OPEN:
                active.append((x1, x2))
                active.sort()
            else:    
                active.remove((x1, x2))

            cur_y = y

        return ans % (10**9 + 7)
